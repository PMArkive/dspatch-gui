# I might not update this anytime soon, feel free to fork and modify it yourself if you want to. I don't have the time right now, there's a lot of things that might be interesting, but the scene mostly died down at this point, so I only modified this to deal with things I wanted to do.
# dspatch-gui
a version created for the sole purpose of adding more customizability to the original code with the improvements in terms of customizability, although it isn't really good code for the most part and still needs some improvements, it all currently works.



Current features:
- The current features of the original's
- Ability to modify the Name and Description internally for when viewing in DS Download Play.

Planned Features:
- The ability to modify the icon of the station on the flashcard menu screen.
- The ability to modify the icon of the station on the download station menu screen.
- Potentially, if I can work it out, the ability to change the internal download station icons for legal backups and homebrews that fit the size limit.
- An internal icon creation window for the internal menus.

I would recommend suggesting some features.
