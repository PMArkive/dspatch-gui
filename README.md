# Trying to make the code a bit more neat before updating, to make it a bit easier. I'll be documenting most of what it is doing. and making it easier to understand than when I picked it up.
a version created for the sole purpose of adding more customizability to the original code with the improvements in terms of customizability, although it isn't really good code for the most part and still needs some improvements, it all currently works.



Current features:
- The current features of the original's
- Ability to modify the Name and Description internally for when viewing in DS Download Play.

Planned Features:
- The ability to modify the icon of the station on the flashcard menu screen.
- The ability to modify the icon of the station on the download station menu screen.
- Potentially, if I can work it out, the ability to change the internal download station icons for legal backups and homebrews that fit the size limit.
- An internal icon creation window for the internal menus.

I would recommend suggesting some features.
